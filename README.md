# Features

The [project board](https://github.com/orgs/activist-org/projects/1) is where we organize our work and plan out what's next.

# Preview Video

This is a demo of the [Creating and Joining Events prototype](https://www.figma.com/proto/I9McFfaLu1RiiWp5IP3YjE/activist_public_designs?node-id=1998%3A2577&scaling=contain&page-id=1986%3A1046&starting-point-node-id=1998%3A2577) found on [Figma](https://www.figma.com/file/I9McFfaLu1RiiWp5IP3YjE/activist_designs?node-id=805%3A231):

Further prototypes and designs are available in the [designs for activist](https://www.figma.com/file/I9McFfaLu1RiiWp5IP3YjE/activist_designs?node-id=805%3A231).

# Design and Accessibility

> [!IMPORTANT]
> If you're interested in contributing, contact the team on GitHub or via the email on the [designs welcome page](https://www.figma.com/file/I9McFfaLu1RiiWp5IP3YjE/activist_designs?node-id=805%3A231). We'd love to see a sample of your work! If everything looks good, we'll schedule a time to get connected.

<a href="https://www.figma.com/file/I9McFfaLu1RiiWp5IP3YjE/activist_designs?node-id=805%3A231">
  <img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/activist-org/Organization/main/resources/images/logos/FigmaLogo.png" width="100" alt="Public Figma Designs" align="right">
</a>

We want our tools to look great, be easy to use, and function on any device, while including good security practices. We also consistently put accessibility at the center of what we build.

We make the [designs for activist](https://www.figma.com/file/I9McFfaLu1RiiWp5IP3YjE/activist_designs?node-id=805%3A231) using [Figma](https://www.figma.com).

You can use the [issues](https://github.com/activist-org/activist/issues) to suggest improvements. We mark design-related issues with the [`design`](https://github.com/activist-org/activist/issues?q=is%3Aopen+is%3Aissue+label%3Adesign) label.

# Securely Hosted

We host our data in Iceland with [FlokiNET](https://flokinet.is/), a reputable hosting provider trusted by whistleblowers, activists, and investigative journalists.

Iceland is a strong supporter for net neutrality with strict privacy protection laws and freedom of the press. These factors have contributed to making Iceland a preferred destination for data centers.

You can learn more about FlokiNET on [their blog](https://blog.flokinet.is).

# Community Governance

We not only value, but _need_ open discourse. Our initial feature set was developed together with our growing community of activists.

Our aim is to secure a progressive community by design, while putting platform health before platform growth.

Only organizations that are already on activist will be able to vouch for new organizations that apply to join. Together with experienced activists, we're selecting an initial group of organizations that have a proven track record of inclusivity and elevating underrepresented groups.

We are still developing our operating principles and will always update them based on community decisions. Processes for flagging, banning, guidelines, and rules will always be determined collectively.

</a>

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Want to join our translators working group? Join us in the [localization project on Weblate](https://hosted.weblate.org/projects/activist/activist) and the [Localization channel on Matrix](https://matrix.to/#/!DzbdYyfhjinQBWXgQe:matrix.org?via=matrix.org) to get involved!
>
> See the [localization guide](LOCALIZATION.md) for information on how to get started.

In order to mobilize larger and more diverse coalitions, we need to break down language barriers.

We're growing our network of volunteer contributors to facilitate translation requests for these parts of the platform:

- Organization profiles
- Events
- Resources

We use [Weblate](https://weblate.org) for localization.
